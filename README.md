Hello, I am Rye (Ryan) Godin. 

I currently work for Agriculture and Agri-Foods Canada working towards improving cropland classification with Quantum Machine Learning. 

I have completed my Bachelors of Science in Honours Physics and Astronomy @ University of Waterloo, and I am now working towards my Masters in Computer Science at the Universit√© de Sherbrooke under supervision of Pre Nadia Tahiri and Dr Etienne Lord.

A lot of my code will focus on the encoding of classical information, specifically satellite imagery and bio-informatics, into quantum states.

If you have any questions about my work feel free to contact me, all of my socials are "ryegodin".
