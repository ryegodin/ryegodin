- Hello, I am Rye Godin

I am currently both a student and employee at the University of Waterloo. I am studying Physics and Astronomy and I am entering my 2B term. I am also a CO-OP student, looking for Fall 2022 positions doing research or statistical analysis!

At the University of Waterloo, with all of this online learning, we created a community discord server for our program and year, reaching over 100+ students within the Faculty of
Science. To increase productivity and to practice my JavaScript skills, I developed a bot to allow new functionalities on Discord to help ease student's stress and to reduce
some work to find things. The bot is currently created to have several functionalities, such as Calculus Initial Value Differential Equation calculators, Announcements, a 
database for punishments to be stored to learn SQL and .db storage.

In recent days, I have taken it apon me to learn more about different dependancies, for various uses. I have created two functions I am very proud of. One consisting of the novelcovid package, which allows for users to use my bot to get more information about GLOBAL COVID-19 statitistics, which updates throughout the day on daily cases and totals.
Additionally, I have built an API using axios package, to import content from RESTful API's such as NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day. Importing content such as, the image, description, photo credits and the date. 

Within the School-O (Open) I have posted some of my code which I've written at the University of Waterloo which I was specifically proud of and thought some people might be interested in the topics which are contained within.
