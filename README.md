- Hello, I am Rye Godin

I am currently both a student and employee at the University of Waterloo. I am studying Physics and Astronomy and I am entering my 2B term. I am also a CO-OP student, working in
the Faculty of Engineering for Engineering Outreach, where we work with youth in the Kitchener-Waterloo region to engage them into STEM subjects by preforming activities, labs
or even coding DEMO's to them. 

At the University of Waterloo, with all of this online learning, we created a community discord server for our program and year, reaching over 100+ students within the Faculty of
Science. To increase productivity and to practice my JavaScripting skills, I developed a bot to allow new functionalities on Discord to help ease student's stress and to reduce
some work to find things. The bot is currently created to have several functionalities, such as Calculus Initial Value Differential Equation calculators, Announcements, a 
database for punishments.
